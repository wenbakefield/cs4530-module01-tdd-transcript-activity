Write down the testable behaviors for the satisfaction condition "Add a new grade for an existing student"

addGrade should add the correct grade for the specified student in the specified course
addGrade should add a new grade for a student ONLY if the student already exists in the database

Identify at least two exceptional conditions or design decisions associated with these testable behaviors

If a grade already exists for the student in the specified course, overwrite the existing grade
If the course does not already exist in the student's transcript, add a new course and grade
If the new grade is less than 0 or greater than 100, throw an error
If the student does not already exist in the database, throw an error
If the specified Course does not match the course contained in CourseGrade, throw an error

Design Changes

addGrade and getGrade signatures were modified to take a StudentID, rather than a Student, in accordance with the
functions that have already been implemented
